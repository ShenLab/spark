# We use VEP mainly for gene level annotations

# Default fields to be generated after baseline annotations without custom track or plugin:
#
# VarID - Varinant ID, "Chrom:Pos:Ref:Alt"
# Chrom,Position,Ref,Alt - Variant position and ref/alt alleles
# GeneID - Ensembl gene ID.
# 			If the variant affects overlapping genes, multiple gene IDs will be listed here, and all other
#			gene-based annotations will be sorted by the same order of GeneIDs before packing up.
# Symbol - Gene symbol (enabled by --symbol)
# GeneEff - Gene level effect, taken from the most severe effects from all transcripts
# TransCount - Number of transcripts in each gene that are annotated
# TransIDs - Transcript IDs
# TransBiotypes - Transcript biotypes (enabled by --biotype)
# TransEffs - Functional effect to each annotated transcript
# cDNAChg - cDNA changes for each transcript (enabled by --hgvs)
# CodonChg - Codon changes for each transcript
# AAChg - Amino acid changes for each transcript (in HGVS format when --hgvs is on)
#
# Additional fields added by plugins or options:
#
# Anc - Ancetral allele (by AncestralAllele plugin)
# Context - Trionucleotide sequence context (by Context plugin)
# TransCanon - ID of canonical transcript (enabled by --canonical)
# SpliceReg - Splice region annotation (by SpliceReg plugin) following Zhang S et al. (2018) Genome Research. doi:10.1101/gr.231902.117
# cDNAChg - cDNA change in HGVS format for each transcript (enabled by --hgvs)


[VEP]
# Customize the VEP cache version (useful for matching the version of external gene info)
# Default is to use the same Ensembl version as VEP
# It is generally not recommended for changing VEP cache version, because different releases
# may have different data structure that are incompatible with the perl API.
#DBVer=
# Options for running VEP gene-based annotations
# Default options are: "--gencode_basic --hgvs --symbol --transcript_version --biotype --numbers --offline"
# transcript_version is enabled because transcript exclusion list used below include version number
# --canonical is not enabled in default, because it is not compatible with --gencode_basic: some canonical transcript 
# are not included in GENCODE basic set 
# The current version of GENCODE is v19 for GRCh37 and v27 for GRCh38
# It is possible to tweak VEP options to make it to support full GENCODE genes, custom gene models, or additional plugins.
# If option is specified here, the default will be overriden, be careful about compatibility with other annotation sources
# Comment out options that are not used.
