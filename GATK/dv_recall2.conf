[INPUT]
# Input variant table file (must be tab separated with field names in the first row)
FILE=XXX
# Fields for IID,CHR,POS,REF,ALT
FIELDS=IID,Chrom,Position,Ref,Alt
# Interval padding around the candidate variants.
PADDING=200
# Sample list (single column)
# If not provided, we go-through the variant table to determine available samples

[OUTPUT]
# Output fields for deepvariant re-call (FILTER and QUAL) and nearby variants.
# Nearby variants format: CHR_POS_REF_ALT[Q50]
OUTFIELDS=DeepvarFilter,DeepvarQual,NearbyVars
# Look for nearby variants within this distance 
# Nearby variants can be used for determining parental of origin and resolve multi-nucleotide variants
NEARBY=100

# If pedigree file is provided, we will also re-call other family members
[PED]
# Pedigre file should be "augmented" so that all family members except twin can be determined
# from the relationship specified in PED file alone.
FILE=XXX
# Patterns for technical duplicates
