# Specify prior parameters for each group of variants specified in previous section
# They will be used to calculate BF and PP for each gene
[Prior]
# There are several ways to define priors
# If we do not define groups and do not stratify gene sets
# Then, the format is:
All=Pi:0.05,RRMean_dnLGD1:15,Beta_dnLGD1:0.8,RRMean_dnDmis1:5,Beta_dnDmis1:0.8,RRMean_dnLGD2:16,...
# Note: Variable names should be unique and must have proper order. 
# Pi is the prior fraction of disease genes (which should be the same for all variant classes),
# Pi is then followed by RRMean and Beta for each variant class, they should appear in the same order
# as variants classes are defined in Input section. 


# If we stratify genes into two sets, set-specific priors can be defined
Constrained=Pi:0.09,RRMean_dnLGD1:20,Beta_dnLGD1:0.8,RRMean_dnDmis1:8,Beta_dnDmis1:0.8,RRMean_dnLGD2=18,...
NonCons=Pi:0.03,RRMean_dnLGD1:10,Beta_dnLGD1:0.8,RRMean_dnDmis1:4,Beta_dnDmis1:0.8,RRMean_dnLGD2=9,...

# In the above prior definition, Prior RR/Beta should be defined for each variant class
# But it can become very long and difficult to read.

# Alternatively, if group labels are used, we can define Pi for each gene set first
Constrained=Pi:0.09
NonCons=Pi:0.03

#..., then Gamma mean and beta can be defined separately for each sample group
# Number of Mean/Beta pairs should be the same as the number of variant classes selected for that group. 
Simplex.Constrained=RRMean_dnLGD:17,Beta_dnLGD:0.8,RRMean_dnDmis:5.5,Beta_dnDmis:0.8
Simplex.NonCons=RRMean_dnLGD:6,Beta_dnLGD:0.8,RRMean_dnDmis:5.5,Beta_dnDmis:0.8
# If we want to omit certain variant class for a specific gene set for a sample group
# for example, LGD in NonCons genes for Multiplex, we can set priors for NA using NAChar defined above 
Multiplex.Constrained=RRMean_dnLGD:6,Beta_dnLGD:0.8,RRMean_dnDmis:3.5,Beta_dnDmis:0.8
Multiplex.NonCons=RRMean_dnLGD:.,Beta_dnLGD:0.8,RRMean_dnDmis:3.5,Beta_dnDmis:0.8
# If certain set (non-constrained) of genes is not to be included in some sample group 
# We can omit their prior parameters here.
CaseCtrl.Constrained=RRMean_dnLGD:6,Beta_dnLGD:0.8
CasePsudCtrl.Constrained=RRMean_dnLGD:4,Beta_dnLGD:0.8
# Prior for some gene set in some group can be mssing, here we do not have priors for noncons genes in 
# case-control data. In such case, variant in that gene set does not contribute to BF.



# Priors can also be stored in a table file such that each column is a variable and each row represent a sampling.
# Priors can be estimated by extTADA abd full MCMC sampling can be taken.
# In this case, make sure to have one file for each gene set and priors column start from pi and followed by
# RR and beta for variant classes that in the same as order as defined above.
# Update 202005:
# Now it is also possible to specify multiple prior tables for each gene set
# Effectively, this allows multiple classes of disease genes that are targeted by different classes of variants.
Constrained=/path/to/constrained/genes/priors.txt
NonCons=/path/to/noncons/genes/priors.txt

# Using prior stored in a table file, we can also have gene-specific prior
# In this case, the first column will be used as GeneID, second column will be gene-specific pi, 
# the followed by gene-specific RR/beta for variant classes defined above in the same order
