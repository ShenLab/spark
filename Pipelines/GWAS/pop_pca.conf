[SMARTPCA]
#numoutevec:     number of eigenvectors to output.  Default is 10.
#numoutlieriter: maximum number of outlier removal iterations.
#  Default is 5.  To turn off outlier removal, set this parameter to 0.
# <--- for multi population analysis, we should turn off this option
numoutlieriter=0
#numoutlierevec: number of principal components along which to 
#  remove outliers during each outlier removal iteration.  Default is 10.
#outliersigmathresh: number of standard deviations which an individual must 
#  exceed, along one of the top (numoutlierevec) principal components, in
#  order for that individual to be removed as an outlier.  Default is 6.0.
#outlieroutname: output logfile of outlier individuals removed. If not specified,
#  smartpca will print this information to stdout, which is the default.
#usenorm: Whether to normalize each SNP by a quantity related to allele freq.
#  Default is YES.  (When analyzing microsatellite data, should be set to NO.
#  See Patterson et al. 2006.)
#altnormstyle: Affects very subtle details in normalization formula.
#  Default is YES (normalization formulas of Patterson et al. 2006)
#  To match EIGENSTRAT (normalization formulas of Price et al. 2006), set to NO.
#missingmode: If set to YES, then instead of doing PCA on # reference alleles,
#  do PCA on whether each data point is missing or nonmissing.  Default is NO.
#  May be useful for detecting informative missingness (Clayton et al. 2005).
#ldregress: If set to a positive integer, then LD regression is turned on,
#  and input to PCA will be the residual of a regression involving that many
#  previous SNPs, according to physical location.  See Patterson et al. 2006.
#  Default is 0 (no LD regression).  If desiring LD correction, we recommend 200.
ldregress=200
#ldlimit: If doing LD regression, this is the maximum genetic distance (in
#  Morgans) for previous SNPs used to construct the residual. Default is no
#  maximum, for typical genotype SNP data, 0.001 is sufficient.
#ldposlimit: If doing LD regression, this is the maximum physical distance (in
#  basepairs) for previous SNPs used to construct the residual. Default is no
#  maximum, for typical genotype SNP data, 100000 is sufficient.
ldposlimit=100000
#ldr2lo: If doing LD regression, this is the minimum squared correlation to a
#  previous SNP for that SNP to be used in constructing the residual. Default
#  is 0.01.
#ldr2hi: If doing LD regression, this is the minimum squared correlation to a
#  previous SNP for the *current* SNP to be excluded from the computation (so
#  as to avoid a singular matrix in this or future regressions). Default is 0.95.
#grmoutname: Output file prefix containing the lower-triangular of the genetic
#  relatedness matrix (written to [grmoutname]) and ordered sample identifiers
#  (written to [grmoutname].id). Format is compatible with heritability estimation
#  software GCTA (as of v1.13, see: http://www.complextraitgenomics.com/software/gcta/).
#  For direct input to GCTA, ensure that the last four characters of [grmoutname]
#  are ".grm" and gzip the resulting [grmoutname] file.
#grmbinary: If [grmoutname] is specified and this value is set to "YES" then the
#  genetic relatedness matrix will be written in binary format: three files
#  corresponding to the lower-triangular of the GRM ([grmoutname].bin), the number
#  of SNPs used for the computation ([grmoutname].N.bin), and the ordered sample
#  identifiers ([grmoutname].id). See documentation for GCTA (as of v1.13) for 
#  detailed format spec (http://www.complextraitgenomics.com/software/gcta/).
#  Default is NO.
#poplistname:   If wishing to infer eigenvectors using only individuals from a 
#  subset of populations, and then project individuals from all populations 
#  onto those eigenvectors, this input file contains a list of population names,
#  one population name per line, which will be used to infer eigenvectors.  
#  It is assumed that the population of each individual is specified in the 
#  indiv file.  Default is to use individuals from all populations.
# <---- this option will also be enabled by pipeline
#phylipoutname: output file containing an fst matrix which can be used as input
#  to programs in the PHYLIP package, such as the "fitch" program for
#  constructing phylogenetic trees.
#noxdata:    if set to YES, all SNPs on X chr are excluded from the data set.
#  The smartpca default for this parameter is YES, since different variances 
#  for males vs. females on X chr may confound PCA analysis.
#nomalexhet: if set to YES, any het genotypes on X chr for males are changed
#  to missing data.  The smartpca default for this parameter is YES.
#badsnpname: specifies a list of SNPs which should be excluded from the data set.
#  Same format as example.snp.  Cannot be used if input is in
#  PACKEDPED or PACKEDANCESTRYMAP format.
#popsizelimit: If set to a positive integer, the result is that a randomly
#  selected subset of size popsizelimit individuals from each population 
#  will be included in the analysis. It is assumed that the population of each 
#  individual is specified in the indiv file.  Default is to use all individuals 
#  in the analysis.
#snpweightoutname: output file containing SNP weightings of each
#  principal component.  Note that this output file does not contain entries
#  for monomorphic SNPs from the input .snp file. 
#chrom: Only use SNPs on this chromosome.
#lopos: Only use SNPs with physical position >= this value.
#hipos: Only use SNPs with physical position <= this value.
#blgsize: Size (in Morgans) of blocks used in FST stderr jackknife computation.
#  The default value for this parameter is 0.05.
#qtmode: If set to YES, assume that there is a single population and that the
#  population field contains information on real-valued phenotypes.
#  The default value for this parameter is NO.
#fstonly: If set to YES, then skip PCA and just calculate FST values.  
#  The default value for this parameter is NO.
#fstdetailsname:  mybig.out 
# Outputs details for fst including estimates for each SNP
